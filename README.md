# GitHub Crawler 

here is what it can do:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Search and write resulting repository names</li>
	<li>Crawl a repository and find information like commit counts, contributor count, name and owner</li>
	<li>Find the names of the people of an organization and then find the average repository count of those people (the organization url is hardcoded right now)</li>
	<li>Find trending repositories</li>
</ul>
